List of code projects to be done:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Add HISQ GPU fermion force interface and update.

In the plain MILC version, implement Osborn's improvements to the HISQ
fermion force

Mixed precision staggered inverter.

Try reliable update algorithm for clover fermions.

Fix handling of file and propagator metadata.  We need to create the
info strings from generic routines and use current info in the
mass/kappa structures plus source structures.

Allow ASCII labels for source, quark, and propagators in
clover_invert2 and ks_spectrum.

Let "EO" override the fermion type in the improved actions

Fix rephasing for SU(3) for HISQ

Make MILC staggered inverter interface similar to QOP's

Check that all important macro options are documented in output logs.

General housekeeping
  Rationalize fermion_force interface
  Fix file title info
  Put make 3rd neighbors in a generic dir.
  Make internal prototypes static
  Clean out scrapped (commented) code

Fold in Beat Jegerlehner's multimass clover inverter

Throughout:
  Continue moving toward field-major layout.

Continue testing prefetching and layout strategies.

Fix arb_dirac_eigen?  It has not been debugged for parallel running.

Regression tests for ks_spectrum code.

C. DeTar 6/11/2011

This directory contains test input and output files.  The test input
files are created from the corresponding abbreviated *.param files
using

  make sample-in

Note that you can also create custom input files by hand from the
example patterns by first creating an appropriate *.param file and
then running the build_input*.sh scripts as follows

  build_input.<name>.sh  <name>.param > <inputfile>

The regression test suite is specified by the "checklist" file.  To
run all the regression tests specified in the checklist file, run

  make check

in the source code directory.

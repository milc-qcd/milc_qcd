# Generic make-include file for all applications
# For inclusion in an application-specific Make_test
# Not intended to be used as a standalone.
# C.D. 3/26/05

# For making the test output.  Results are put in out.test.diff.${PROJ}

# Instructions...
# 1.  Copy the Makefile to the application directory and edit it
#     for the options and architecture you desire
# 2.  Select the appropriate job launch command below by uncommenting
#     the appropriate set or creating one.
# 3.  Go to the application directory
# 4.  There should already be sample input and output files constructed from
#     code that you trust and the corresponding error tolerance files.
#     The sample files are called in.sample.TARGET out.sample.TARGET
#     and out.errtol.TARGET where TARGET is built from "make TARGET".
#     The test output file is called out.test.TARGET.
#     To create an error tolerance file, see instructions in seterrfile.pl.
# 5.  In the application directory, run the command
#        make -f Make_test check > & maketest.log
# 6.  Results are reported in files called out.test.diff.*
#     These files show differences between the sample and test output files.
#     using the error tolerance file to determine compliance.
#     Results are also reported to stderr so should appear in maketest.log
#     Look for lines with "Error" and "NOT OK".
# 6.  The variable CUSTOM is normally undefined in the master
#     Make_test file.  With this choice the test consists of comparing
#     stdout from a test run with the corresponding sample output file.
#     The rule for making this file is supplied here.
#     Changing CUSTOM to another name and supplying a rule in the master 
#     Make_test file for the file out.test${CUSTOM}.${PROJ} allows a custom 
#     test - for example a test comparing output other than stdout.
#     A corresponding out.sample${CUSTOM}.${PROJ} must be supplied.
#
# For the "heavy" application, follow instructions in heavy/Make_test

# Provisions for architecture-dependent job launching
# Change to suit...

# The job is launched with the commad
# ${LAUNCH} ./${PROJ} ${LAUNCH2} < in.sample.${PROJ} > out.test.${PROJ}

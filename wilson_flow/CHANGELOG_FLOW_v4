CHANGELOG FLOW v4:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version of the gradient flow application includes a wide range of edits, 
some of which are fairly generic, while others are specific to the SPHALERON 
application.

GENERIC STUFF:
a) Added the Zeuthen correction ot the flow action. Now three options for 
the flow action are Wilson, Symanzik, Zeuthen. If needed anisotropy is accounted 
for. Chosen via input files independent of the integrators.

b) Local field implementations of field strengths (separately spatial or temporal) 
without reference to a fieldstrength in the sites. Wrappers to do both at once. 
Independent of generic/fieldstrenght.c.

c) Added the improved clover definition of the field strength tensor. Those are
computed anyways.
Sequence Bc,Ec,Bi,Ei.

d) Added improved-clover Ei^2 and Bi^2 with three extra improved-clover Qtops as 
EcBc, EcBi, EiBc, EiBi. Their output as 
Ec^2,Bc^2,Ei^2,Bi^2,Ep^2,Bp^2,Er^2,Bp^2, Qcc,Qci,Qic,Qii is triggered via 
compiler macro "REPORT=2". "REPORT=0" reports only zeroth and last flow steps. 

e) All auxiliary field variables for flow integration can be taken out from the 
sites. Reduces memory footprint and code becomes typically ~20% faster. Triggered 
by compiler macro "USE_FIELD". Separate versions w/o USE_FIELD exist.
Module/function interfaces are kept the same wherever possible.

f) Auxiliary helper functions for SU3-group/algebra fields in flow integration 
taken out from integrate.c, and reorganized together with others in flow_helpers.c.

g) New versions/functionalities automatically included in flow executables labeled 
"region_flow" instead of "wilson_flow"; the latter use the old structures and 
are 100% backwards compatible (in all tests that were done). 

h) Distinction between different versions of flow triggered via "REGIONS" macro.
All existing modules have REGIONALIZED version, i.e.
field_strength_region.c
fmunu_region.c
integrate_region.c
staple_region.c
Module/function interfaces are kept the same wherever possible.

i) Fixed generic/axial.c to be independent of a staple component using local fields.

j) Generally streamlined and improved code consistency/conventions across 
different modules.


NON-GENERIC STUFF FOR SPHALERON APPLICATION:
Any not at least potentiall generic additions are triggered by the macro SPHALERON.
There are a few key pieces of logic of behind these additions. 
Namely, the entirety of 3D vs 4D flow, flow or observables restricted to certain 
REGIONS, limitations in the number of directions (no TUP links), and BLOCKING. 
These can be controlled by two parameters, named "block_stride" and "region(_flag)".

BLOCKING:
A block_stride parameter implies that only every "block_stride"th site in each 
spatial direction holds a non-trivial link (that has been extended to a length 
of "block_stride"). So far, this is done for factors of two up to factor four 
in total. For this purpose 2n- and 4n-gathers are defined. Adding 8n-gather 
would be trivial. Merging with applications inlcuding 3n-gathers needs some care.

Blocking via the "spatial_blocking" function. Once the blocking has been done, 
sites are skipped via the "IF_BLOCKED(s, block_stride)" statement. "block_stride" 
is an external variable (set to 1 if BLOCKING is undefined). 
Special care is required when building the staples, the fieldstrengths, etc. 
A function "setup_blocked_dirs" populates 2-arrays for blocked forward and 
backward directions to be used in gathers. Aware of temporal vs spatial. 
Corresponding macros indefines.h. 

There is one test, which checks the first stage of BLOCKING, and explicitly 
builds blocked plaquettes and rectangles from unblocked links, then blocks, 
rebuilds and compares all of these loops. Compile as "debug_blocking".
Not yet sure, to which extent this can be fully generalized. 

REGIONS:
Calculations in different regions may use different fields. These have been 
excorporated from the sites, and turned into fields. Most definitions in 
defines.h. Region-specific versions of observables in 
field_strength_region.c and fmunnu_region.c.

The FULLVOL region corrsponds to all directions and standard 4D flow. 
The corresponding FULL 4D observables are accessible through
void 
make_fieldstrength_full ( su3_matrix **fieldstrength );
void
fmunu_fmunu_full( double *time, double *space, double *charge );
void
gauge_action_w_s_full( double wlt[2], double wls[2] );
The corresponding flow is accessible with "region_flag = FULLVOL" through 
void 
run_gradient_flow( int region_flag );

The BULK region corresponds to 4D flow with fixed spatial links in its 
temporal boundary slices. This setup works without fixing AXIAL GAUGE. 
Once AXIAL GAUGE is fixed, the temporal links in the BULK 
observables could be omitted analogous to the HALF observables; this is 
triggered by the macro DROP_TIME_LINKS, but not exactly equivalent, since 
4D flow in the bulk changes the temporal links ever slightly. For topology 
this is not expected to change anything.

The corresponding BULK observables are accessible through
void 
make_fieldstrength_bulk ( su3_matrix **fieldstrength );
void
fmunu_fmunu_bulk( double *time, double *space, double *charge );
void 
gauge_action_w_s_bulk( double wlt[2], double wls[2] );
There is an alternative set of bulk observables accessible through 
void 
make_fieldstrength_half ( field_offset link_src, 
                          su3_matrix **fieldstrength );
void
fmunu_fmunu_half( double *time, double *space, double *charge );
void 
gauge_action_w_s_half( double wlt[2], double wls[2] );
where the spatial links have been interpolated to half-integer time, 
and temporal loops use half-integer time steps.

The corresponding BULK flow is accessible with "region_flag = BULK" through 
void 
run_gradient_flow( int region_flag );

In the construction of staples for spatial links, one has to pay attention that 
the temporal staples for these links could receive contributions from spatial 
links outside of the regions. For that purpose a separate REGIONALIZED version 
of staple.c has been produced. Temporal staples in iproved flow actions 
(Symanzik or Zeuthen) are swapped for Wilson flow staples (with corresponding 
coefficients) whenever the flow is restricted to regions other than FULLVOL.

The BOUNDARY region corresponds to 3D flow within the fixed temporal boundaries. 

The corresponding BOUNDARY observables are accessible through
void 
make_fieldstrength_bdry ( field_offset link_src, 
                          su3_matrix **link_last_flow, 
                          su3_matrix **fieldstrength );
void 
fmunu_fmunu_bdry( su3_matrix **link_last_flow, 
                  double *time, double *space, double *charge );
void 
gauge_action_w_s_bdry( su3_matrix **link_last_flow,  
                       double wlt[2], double wls[2] );
The temporal/electric/topological observables make only sense once 
"su3_matrix **link_last_flow" has been populated during the flow evolution.

The corresponding BOUNDARY flow is accessible with "region_flag = BOUNDARY" through 
void 
run_gradient_flow_region( int region_flag );
